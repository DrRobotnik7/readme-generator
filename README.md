## Usage

URL: https://drrobotnik7.github.io/readme-generator/

Users can type a city into the search box to be shown the current weather and a 5 day forecast. If the user would like to specify a country they can e.g. if searching for Bristol, the result is the city in the US. You can type in Bristol, UK instead.

The results are saved in the search history on the left side of the page. You can clear the search history using the 'Clear History' button.

The search history persists after the page is refreshed.
