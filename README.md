- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

- Install node.js on your system.
- Save the README-generator code to your hard drive.
- Navigate to the folder containing index.js, either with the command prompt or with VS Code's integrated terminal. 
- Type "node index.js" to run the application

## Usage

The README generator will ask the first question - What is the title of your project? Type this in and proceed through the remainder of the questions.

There are two questions that require you to use the arrows on your keyboard to select your choice.

Once completed the README will be generated and saved in the same folder as the index.js file.
